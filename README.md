1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account (if you don't have write access).
2. Click the green **Code** button on your fork.
3. Select **Open with Codespaces** > **New codespace**.
4. Wait for the environment to initialize. A VS Code instance will launch in your browser.
5. Use the terminal or integrated tools to navigate to the desired edition folder (`2024/`, `2025ed/`, etc.).
6. Follow the instructions provided in that edition’s README or setup file.

> Make sure your browser supports Codespaces and you have access to GitHub Codespaces in your account.
> The enterprises accounts, e.g., the one priveded to install github copilot, does not work with codespaces. You'll need a personal github account.
